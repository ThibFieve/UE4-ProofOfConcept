Building Escape is a proof of concept/ Demo game made in the UE4. The assets are from the UE4 Market Place.  
You can run the game by launching the executable folder from my Google Drive:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lDEXv-LgYk_nElvTLPgUgmeytXX15CpQ?usp=sharing  
This is more of a Tech Demo than a fully fledge game , as you can escape the room simply by going on the Statue alter , or by moving the statue from one to another.  

The goal of this game is to escape the room , by grabbing and moving objects. Press right click to grab objects.  

The game has :  
-Physics of object   
-Grabbing of Object-> Ray Casting  
-Use of collision volume and trigger volumes   
-Physics Based collision : ie the door will only open if an Object , or many of them are heavy enough  on the pressure plate.  
-Hand Made Implementation of the Moon using BluePrints

You can escape by putting the Gargol hidden inside a pot on the right on the right alter , you can also move the other Gargol from one alter to another or even step on top of the Alter.
