# UE4-ProofOfConcpet
ProofOfConcepts UE4 Games made following along the Epic Games officially endorsed UDEMY course.


Building Escape is a proof of concept/ Demo game made in the UE4. The assets are from the UE4 Market Place.
This is more of a Tetch Demo than a fully fledge game , as you can escape the room simply by going on the Statue alter , or by moving the statue from one to another.

The goal of this game is to escape the room , by grabbing and moving objects.


The game has :
-Physics of object 
-Grabbing of Object-> Ray Casting
-Use of collision volume and trigger volumes 
-Physics Based collision : ie the door will only open if an Object heavy enough is put on the pressure plate.
