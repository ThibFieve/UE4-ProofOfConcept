Handeling HitEven in UE4 





Attachment trhough C++ , EVEN THE CAMERA , but it's waaaaaay easier to do it via blueprints !




Lesson 157 , MULTICAST delegate
Casting,
Child and parents class
Template functions
forward declaration 
Timer events , and independant of the framerate
UPROPERTY macro UPROPERTY and UFUNCTION

Health Component class with mutlicast delegate for Damage systen of UE4
auto  , allows the compiler to figure out the type of a variable
we want a UClass of the class UDamageType , to do so we can call a static function called StaticClass
//  //ATower::StatiClass() returns teh Uclass !
or 
TSubclassOf<class UMatineeCameraShake> DeathCameraShakeClass;

AGamemode class , derived from actor class , or GameModebBase , 

Public Get function and code best practice, public classes access
Custom controller class for input deletion when starting or dead

Timer System and Time delegate of the UE4, Making Our own Delegate Variable for time management and delayed input lesson 163

Blueprint implemetable events , lesson 164 , function called in C++ but implemented in bluepritns they cannot be private.  -> UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)
StartGame and GameOver lesson 164 and 167



Using Widget to print on the screen , lesson 164 , widget are for displaying things on screen like text
Switch nodes blueprints lesson 165

//  //ATower::StatiClass() returns teh Uclass !

//remark when passing a adress of a fucntion dont put thte ()
